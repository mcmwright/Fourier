# Fourier
## M C M Wright, ISVR, University Southampton

This series of notebooks introduces Fourier concepts for Acoustical Engineering students at the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research.
The material is complementary to module 24 of the first year self-paced maths course.

Eventually the material will cover series, transforms and digital transforms. So far it only covers series.
